# ÉCLAIREUR PUBLIC - Frontend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

You can get started by installing the dependencies by running:

```bash
yarn install
```

Then run and watch the dev environment with:

```bash
yarn dev
```

For formatting the code using prettier run:

```bash
yarn format
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Local environment variables
Create a .env.local file in the folder /front
add the following environment variables

```
POSTGRESQL_ADDON_HOST=
POSTGRESQL_ADDON_DB=
POSTGRESQL_ADDON_USER=
POSTGRESQL_ADDON_PORT=
POSTGRESQL_ADDON_PASSWORD=
POSTGRESQL_ADDON_URI=
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Development Tools

### Storybook

Storybook is set up for component development and documentation.

#### Running Storybook
```bash
yarn run storybook
```

This will start Storybook on [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006)

#### Building Storybook
```bash
yarn run build-storybook
```

#### Creating Stories
Stories are located alongside components with the `.stories.tsx` extension. Examples:
- `components/ui/button.stories.tsx`
- `components/SearchBar/SearchBar.stories.tsx`
- `app/components/HomePageHeader.stories.tsx`

### Visual Regression Testing with BackstopJS

BackstopJS is configured for visual regression testing of Storybook components using Playwright engine.

#### Running Visual Tests
```bash
# Build Storybook first
yarn build-storybook

# Start Storybook server
yarn storybook

# Generate initial reference images (first time only)
yarn backstop:reference

# Run visual regression tests
yarn backstop:test
```

#### Updating Baselines
When you intentionally change component visuals:
```bash
yarn backstop:approve
```

#### Viewing Test Reports
```bash
# Open the latest test report in browser
yarn backstop:report
```

#### GitHub Integration
When running in CI/CD:
- **Main branch**: Reports are automatically deployed to GitHub Pages at `https://[username].github.io/[repo-name]/backstop-reports/[run-number]/`
- **Pull Requests**: A comment is automatically added with a direct link to the visual regression report
- **Artifacts**: Reports and test results are uploaded as GitHub Actions artifacts for 30 days

#### Visual Test Results
- Reference images: `./backstop_data/bitmaps_reference/`
- Test screenshots: `./backstop_data/bitmaps_test/`
- HTML reports: `./backstop_data/html_report/`
- CI reports: `./backstop_data/ci_report/`

### End-to-End Testing with Playwright

Playwright is configured for E2E testing.

#### Running E2E Tests
```bash
# Run tests headlessly
yarn run test

# Run tests with UI
yarn run test:ui

# Run tests in headed mode
yarn run test:headed
```

#### Test Files
E2E tests are located in the `tests/` directory:
- `tests/homepage.spec.ts`

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit/Component Testing**: Storybook stories serve as component documentation and manual testing
2. **Visual Regression Testing**: BackstopJS automatically detects visual changes in components
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Playwright tests cover user workflows and integration scenarios

## Contributing

1. Create component stories for new components
2. Run visual regression tests before submitting PRs
3. Ensure E2E tests pass
4. Follow the established code formatting standards
